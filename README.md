# tidal
Lua game engine

## Features
- Tested for Linux, but probably works on other OSs
- Because it is programmed in Lua, adding scripts to a game is already built-in
- Uses Vulkan instead of the popular OpenGL
- Physics engine using Chipmunk2d
- Objects can be defined using plain text (Json)
- UI system to simplify menu creation

Features will be added to suit other projects I'm working on.
